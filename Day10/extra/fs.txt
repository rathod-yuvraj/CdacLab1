Introduction to Node.js File System
The Node.js File System module (fs) provides a comprehensive set of methods for working with the file system on your computer.

It allows you to perform file I/O operations in both synchronous and asynchronous ways.

Note: The File System module is a core Node.js module, so no installation is required.

Importing the File System Module
You can import the File System module using CommonJS require() or ES modules import syntax:

CommonJS (Default in Node.js)
const fs = require('fs');
ES Modules (Node.js 14+ with "type": "module" in package.json)
import fs from 'fs';
// Or for specific methods:
// import { readFile, writeFile } from 'fs/promises';
Promise-based API
Node.js provides promise-based versions of the File System API in the fs/promises namespace, which is recommended for modern applications:

// Using promises (Node.js 10.0.0+)
const fs = require('fs').promises;

// Or with destructuring
const { readFile, writeFile } = require('fs').promises;

// Or with ES modules
// import { readFile, writeFile } from 'fs/promises';
Common Use Cases

Reading Files
Node.js provides several methods to read files, including both callback-based and promise-based approaches.

The most common method is fs.readFile().

Note: Always handle errors when working with file operations to prevent your application from crashing.

Reading Files with Callbacks
Here's how to read a file using the traditional callback pattern:

myfile.txt

This is the content of myfile.txt
Create a Node.js file that reads the text file, and return the content:

Example: Reading a file with callbacks
const fs = require('fs');

// Read file asynchronously with callback
fs.readFile('myfile.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error reading file:', err);
    return;
  }
  console.log('File content:', data);
});

// For binary data (like images), omit the encoding
fs.readFile('image.png', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  // data is a Buffer containing the file content
  console.log('Image size:', data.length, 'bytes');
});
Reading Files with Promises (Modern Approach)
Using fs.promises or util.promisify for cleaner async/await syntax:

Example: Reading a file with async/await
// Using fs.promises (Node.js 10.0.0+)
const fs = require('fs').promises;

async function readFileExample() {
  try {
    const data = await fs.readFile('myfile.txt', 'utf8');
    console.log('File content:', data);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error reading file:', err);
  }
}

readFileExample();

// Or with util.promisify (Node.js 8.0.0+)
const { promisify } = require('util');
const readFileAsync = promisify(require('fs').readFile);

async function readWithPromisify() {
  try {
    const data = await readFileAsync('myfile.txt', 'utf8');
    console.log(data);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
}

readWithPromisify();
Reading Files Synchronously
For simple scripts, you can use synchronous methods, but avoid them in production servers as they block the event loop:

Example: Reading a file synchronously
const fs = require('fs');

try {
  // Read file synchronously
  const data = fs.readFileSync('myfile.txt', 'utf8');
  console.log('File content:', data);
} catch (err) {
  console.error('Error reading file:', err);
}
Best Practice: Always specify the character encoding (like 'utf8') when reading text files to get a string instead of a Buffer.

Creating and Writing Files
Node.js provides several methods for creating and writing to files.

Here are the most common approaches:

1. Using fs.writeFile()
Creates a new file or overwrites an existing file with the specified content:
---------------------------------------
Using fs.appendFile()
Appends content to a file, creating the file if it doesn't exist:
-----------------------------------------------
Using File Handles
For more control over file operations, you can use file handles:
------------------------------------------------
Using Streams for Large Files
For writing large amounts of data, use streams to avoid high memory usage:
-------------------------------------------------------
File Flags: When opening files, you can specify different modes:

'w' - Open for writing (file is created or truncated)
'wx' - Like 'w' but fails if the path exists
'w+' - Open for reading and writing (file is created or truncated)
'a' - Open for appending (file is created if it doesn't exist)
'ax' - Like 'a' but fails if the path exists
'r+' - Open for reading and writing (file must exist)
----------------------------------------------------

Deleting Files and Directories
Node.js provides several methods to delete files and directories.

Here's how to handle different deletion scenarios:

1. Deleting a Single File
Use fs.unlink() to delete a file:
Deleting Multiple Files
To delete multiple files, you can use Promise.all() with fs.unlink():

2. Deleting Directories
To delete directories, you have several options depending on your needs:

4. Emptying a Directory Without Deleting It
To remove all files and subdirectories within a directory but keep the directory itself:

4. Emptying a Directory Without Deleting It
To remove all files and subdirectories within a directory but keep the directory itself:

Renaming and Moving Files
The fs.rename() method can be used for both renaming and moving files.

It's a versatile method for file system operations that involve changing file paths.

1. Basic File Renaming
To rename a file in the same directory:
2. Moving Files Between Directories
You can use fs.rename() to move files between directories:
3. Batch Renaming Files
To rename multiple files matching a pattern:
4. Atomic Rename Operations
For critical operations, use a temporary file to ensure atomicity:
