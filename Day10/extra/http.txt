    Node.js has a built -in module called http that allows you to create 
    a web server.With it, you can handle HTTP requests and send responses.
    You don’t need to install anything extra.

2️⃣ Basic Example: Hello World Server
const http = require('http'); // Import the HTTP module

// Create a server
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    // Set response header
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });

    // Send response body
    res.end('Hello World from Node.js HTTP server!\n');
});

// Server listens on port 3000
server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running at http://localhost:3000/');
});
Understanding the Code
http.createServer() - Creates a new HTTP server instance
The callback function is executed for each request with two parameters:
req - The request object (http.IncomingMessage)
res - The response object (http.ServerResponse)
res.writeHead() - Sets the response status code and headers
res.end() - Sends the response and ends the connection
server.listen() - Starts the server on the specified port

✅ Explanation:

require('http') → Imports the HTTP module.

    http.createServer() → Creates the server.It takes a callback with request(req) and response(res) objects.

        res.writeHead(200, { ...}) → Sets HTTP status code(200 = OK) and headers.

            res.end('...') → Sends the response and ends it.

                server.listen(3000) → Makes the server listen on port 3000.

3️⃣ Accessing the server

Save the file as server.js.

Run it in terminal:

node server.js


Open browser → http://localhost:3000 → You’ll see “Hello World from Node.js HTTP server!”

4️⃣ Notes

You can send HTML instead of plain text:

res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' });
res.end('<h1>Hello HTML World</h1>');


You can handle different routes:

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    if (req.url === '/') {
        res.end('Home Page');
    } else if (req.url === '/about') {
        res.end('About Page');
    } else {
        res.statusCode = 404;
        res.end('Page Not Found');
    }
});


Working with HTTP Headers
HTTP headers let you send additional information with your response.

The res.writeHead() method is used to set the status code and response headers.

Common HTTP Status Codes
Code	Message	Description
200	OK	Standard response for successful HTTP requests
201	Created	Request has been fulfilled and new resource created
301	Moved Permanently	Resource has been moved to a new URL
400	Bad Request	Server cannot process the request due to client error
401	Unauthorized	Authentication is required
403	Forbidden	Server refuses to authorize the request
404	Not Found	Requested resource could not be found
500	Internal Server Error	Unexpected condition was encountered


Common Response Headers
Content-Type: Specifies the media type of the content (e.g., text/html, application/json)
Content-Length: The length of the response body in bytes
Location: Used in redirects (with 3xx status codes)
Set-Cookie: Sets HTTP cookies on the client
Cache-Control: Directives for caching mechanisms
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: For CORS support

Working with URLs and Query Strings
Node.js provides built-in modules to work with URLs and query strings, making it easy to handle different parts of a URL and parse query parameters.

Accessing the Request URL
The req.url property contains the URL string that was requested, including any query parameters.

This is part of the http.IncomingMessage objects

Parsing URLs with the URL Module
The url module provides utilities for URL resolution and parsing.

It can parse a URL string into a URL object with properties for each part of the URL.
Common URL Parsing Methods
url.parse(urlString, [parseQueryString], [slashesDenoteHost]): Parse a URL string into an object
url.format(urlObject): Format a URL object into a URL string
url.resolve(from, to): Resolve a target URL relative to a base URL
new URL(input, [base]): The WHATWG URL API (recommended for new code)
querystring.parse(str, [sep], [eq], [options]): Parse a query string into an object
querystring.stringify(obj, [sep], [eq], [options]): Stringify an object into a query string
Handling Different HTTP Methods
RESTful APIs commonly use different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform different operations on resources.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Best Practices for HTTP Methods
GET: Retrieve a resource or collection of resources (should be idempotent)
POST: Create a new resource (not idempotent)
PUT: Update an existing resource or create it if it doesn't exist (idempotent)
PATCH: Partially update a resource
DELETE: Remove a resource (idempotent)
HEAD: Same as GET but without the response body
OPTIONS: Describe the communication options for the target resource
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Error Handling
Always include proper error handling and appropriate HTTP status codes:

200 OK - Successful GET/PUT/PATCH
201 Created - Successful resource creation
204 No Content - Successful DELETE
400 Bad Request - Invalid request data
401 Unauthorized - Authentication required
403 Forbidden - Not enough permissions
404 Not Found - Resource doesn't exist
500 Internal Server Error - Server-side error

Introduction to the HTTPS Module
The HTTPS module is a core Node.js module that provides an implementation of the HTTPS protocol, which is essentially HTTP over TLS/SSL.

It's a secure version of the HTTP module, providing encrypted communication between clients and servers.

Why Use HTTPS?
HTTPS is crucial for modern web applications because it:

Encrypts Data: Protects sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data from eavesdropping
Authenticates Servers: Verifies that clients are communicating with the intended server
Ensures Data Integrity: Prevents data from being modified or corrupted during transfer
Builds Trust: Visual indicators (like the padlock icon) increase user confidence
Improves SEO: Search engines prioritize HTTPS websites in search results
Enables Modern Features: Many web APIs (like Geolocation, Service Workers) require HTTPS
How HTTPS Works
Client initiates a secure connection to the server
Server presents its SSL/TLS certificate to the client
Client verifies the certificate with a trusted Certificate Authority (CA)
Encrypted session is established using asymmetric encryption
Symmetric encryption is used for the actual data transfer
