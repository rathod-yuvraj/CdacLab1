The DOM API is split across many interfaces: Document, Element, Node, EventTarget, Window, etc.

Browsers implement lots of methods, and new APIs are added over time.

There are also properties and events, not just methods.

Rough estimate:

The core DOM specification and common browser implementations include around 100–150 standard DOM methods across all the main interfaces.

For example:

Document interface alone has ~20-30 methods (getElementById(), createElement(), etc.).

Element interface has ~30-40 methods (setAttribute(), querySelector(), appendChild(), etc.).

Node interface has ~10-20 methods.

EventTarget has event-related methods (addEventListener(), removeEventListener()).

Other interfaces (e.g., Window, HTMLDocument) add more.

What are DOM methods?

DOM methods are functions provided by the Document Object Model (DOM) API that allow you to interact with and manipulate HTML/XML documents using JavaScript.

There isn’t a fixed number because the DOM API is quite extensive and varies between HTML, XML, and browser implementations.

But there are dozens of commonly used DOM methods that developers use daily.

Some common and important DOM methods include:
Method	Description
getElementById()	Select an element by its ID
getElementsByClassName()	Select all elements with a certain class name
getElementsByTagName()	Select all elements with a certain tag name
querySelector()	Select the first element matching a CSS selector
querySelectorAll()	Select all elements matching a CSS selector
createElement()	Create a new element
appendChild()	Add a child node to an element
removeChild()	Remove a child node from an element
replaceChild()	Replace a child node with another
cloneNode()	Clone an element (deep or shallow)
setAttribute()	Set an attribute on an element
getAttribute()	Get an attribute from an element
hasAttribute()	Check if an element has a specific attribute
addEventListener()	Attach an event listener to an element
removeEventListener()	Remove an event listener from an element
parentNode	Get the parent node of an element (property)
childNodes	Get a list of child nodes (property)
innerHTML	Get/set HTML content inside an element (property)
textContent	Get/set text content inside an element (property)
classList	Add/remove/toggle classes (property)
Rough count

If you count all methods across Document, Element, Node, EventTarget, etc., there are 50-100+ DOM methods and properties you might encounter.

Browsers keep adding new APIs and extending functionality, so it grows over time.

Summary

No fixed number, but dozens of commonly used DOM methods.

You mainly interact with elements, attributes, nodes, and events using these methods.
