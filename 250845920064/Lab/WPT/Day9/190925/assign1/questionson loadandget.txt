"What types of questions should a student ask a teacher while learning .get() and .load() in jQuery?"

That's a great approach — asking good questions is key to learning deeply.

✅ 1. Conceptual Questions (To Understand the Idea)

Ask your teacher:

What is the difference between $.get() and .load()?

When should I use .load() instead of $.get()?

Is .load() only for HTML? Can it load JSON too?

Does $.get() work with APIs that return JSON?

Are these methods still used in modern development, or is fetch() better?

✅ 2. Syntax & Usage Questions (To Learn How to Use It)

Ask your teacher:

Can you explain the syntax of $.get() and how the parameters work?

How do I pass data (like id=5) using $.get()?

How can I load only part of an HTML file using .load()?

How do I write a callback function inside .load() or $.get()?

✅ 3. Debugging & Error Handling Questions (To Handle Problems)

Ask your teacher:

What should I do if .load() doesn’t show anything?

How can I know if $.get() failed?

How do I debug when data is not loading with $.get()?

What is the best way to show an error message if loading fails?

✅ 4. Real-World Application Questions (To Understand Use Cases)

Ask your teacher:

Can you give an example where .load() is used in a real project?

How is $.get() used to connect with a real API?

Can we use these methods in a login form or a search box?

Is it okay to use .load() for dynamic tabs or modals?

✅ 5. Comparison and Modern Alternatives (To Learn Best Practices)

Ask your teacher:

How does $.get() compare to fetch() or axios?

Is .load() similar to innerHTML in JavaScript?

Are there security risks with .load() like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)?

✅ 6. Hands-On Learning Questions (To Practice Better)

Ask your teacher:

Can we do a mini-project using .get() and .load()?

Can I get a small exercise where I use $.get() to display user data?

Can we build a simple tabbed UI using .load()?

How can I test these methods on my local computer without a server?

🧠 Bonus: What to Say If You’re Confused

If you're stuck, don't be afraid to ask things like:

“I’m confused about the callback function in .load(). Can you explain it again?”

“I tried using $.get() but nothing shows up. Can we check what I did wrong?”

“Can you slow down and explain how the data is passed in $.get()?”

💡 Final Tip:

Your teacher wants to help you — asking specific questions shows you are engaged and eager to learn.
