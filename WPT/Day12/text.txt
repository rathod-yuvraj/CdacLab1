GET, POST, and PUT are different HTTP methods used in Node.js to interact with server resources, each serving distinct purposes:

GET
Used to retrieve data from the server.

Should not modify any server data; it is safe and idempotent.

Parameters are passed in the URL (path or query string).

Responses typically return requested data (JSON, HTML, etc.).

Can be cached and bookmarked.

Example: Fetching user info or a list of items.

POST
Used to create new resources or submit data to the server.

Can modify server state or data.

Data is sent in the request body (e.g., JSON payload).

Not idempotent: multiple identical POSTs may create multiple resources.

Cannot be cached or bookmarked easily.

Example: Submitting a form, creating a new user.

PUT
Used to update existing resources or create them if they don't exist.

Requires sending the full resource representation in the request body.

Idempotent: multiple identical PUT requests result in the same state.

Often used for replacing entire records.

Example: Updating a complete user profile or product data.

Summary Comparison
Feature	GET	POST	PUT
Purpose	Retrieve data	Create new resource	Update or create resource
Request Body	No	Yes	Yes
Idempotent	Yes	No	Yes
Caching	Can be cached	Not cached	Usually not cached
Data in URL	Yes (parameters in URL)	No	No
Safety	Safe (no changes)	Not safe (can change data)	Not safe (modifies data)
Use Case Examples	Get user info, fetch posts	Submit form, add new entry	Update entire user profile
In Node.js Express, these methods map as:

app.get() for GET,

app.post() for POST,

app.put() for PUT.

How the GET Method Works
Express defines GET routes using app.get(path, callback).

Common usage is to fetch all items (e.g., /items) or a specific item by ID (e.g., /items/:id).

The callback receives two parameters: req (request) and res (response).

Example Code
js
app.get('/items', (req, res) => {
    res.json(items); // Returns a list of items
});

app.get('/items/:id', (req, res) => {
    const item = items.find(i => i.id === parseInt(req.params.id));
    if (!item) return res.status(404).send('Item not found');
    res.json(item);
});
These routes handle requests to return all items or a specific item based on the provided ID.

Key Points
Use GET for retrieving data only, not modifying it.

Parameters, such as IDs, are passed using route variables (e.g., /users/:id).

The response is typically JSON data or a status message.

The GET method in Node.js is mainly used to retrieve data from a server, such as fetching records, serving HTML pages, or providing API responses. This method is foundational in both the Node.js native HTTP module and popular frameworks like Express.

What the GET Method Does in Node.js
Requests resources: The GET method allows clients (like browsers or front-end apps) to request specific data or resources from a server using a specified URL.

No request body: According to the HTTP standard, GET requests should never include a request body; parameters are sent via the URL (as path variables or query strings).

Safe and idempotent: GET is safe (should not change server data) and idempotent (multiple identical requests produce the same result), so it's used only for data retrieval, not modification.

Returns data in various formats: A GET request can serve HTML, JSON, plain text, images, or other content as needed.

Handles query parameters: GET endpoints often receive filter, sort, or pagination parameters through the query string, allowing for flexible data retrieval.

Cacheable: GET responses can be cached, making data retrieval faster when possible.

Typical GET Examples in Node.js
With the Built-in HTTP Module:

js
const http = require('http');
http.createServer((req, res) => {
    if (req.method === 'GET' && req.url === '/hello') {
        res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
        res.end('Hello from Node.js!');
    }
}).listen(3000);
With Express:

js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
    res.json([{id: 1, name: 'Alice'}]); // Serve data in JSON
});
app.listen(3000);
In summary, the GET method in Node.js is for safely and reliably accessing resources, making it a core part of APIs, webpages, and data services
